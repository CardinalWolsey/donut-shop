Donut shop assignment for Code Fellows B-31-bootcamp

I took Jeily's code, manually coppied it (typed it all out), and then modified it for my own purposes.

The faunt I used for the hipster ipsum is called Shadows Into Light.  I got it from Google Fonts.

The color scheme is from Adobe Color CC.  It is called neutral blue.

I added the steam roller graphic to my website from here http://codepen.io/khadkamhn/pen/NqBGOW to indicate that the site is still a work in progress.
